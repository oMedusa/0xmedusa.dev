so i finally got around to setting up this blog. been thinking about it for a while now.

## who am i?

i'm Medusa. i spend way too much time breaking things (legally, of course), fixing things, creating thing. This blog is basically my notes dump but public.

## what you'll find here

no fluff, just:

- **ctf writeups** — challenges i've solved, explained without the gatekeeping
- **security stuff** — vulns i find interesting, tools i'm learning, techniques that actually work
- **random thoughts** — sometimes about security, sometimes about how i spent 6 hours debugging something obvious

i write like i think, just technical stuff explained the way i'd explain it to a friend.

## why this exists

honestly? because i kept losing my own notes. figured if i'm documenting everything anyway, might as well make it useful for other people too.

also, writing things down helps me understand them better. if i can't explain it simply, i don't get it well enough.

## let's connect

if you find something useful here, cool. if you spot a mistake, even better — hit me up on [github](https://github.com/oMedusa).

now let's get to the actual content.

```bash
$ whoami
medusa
$ pwd  
/home/medusa/0xmedusa.dev
```

> "If it exist, we can hack it !" — me, probably
